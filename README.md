📈 Mutual Fund Performance Analysis & Investment Forecasting (Python)

📌 Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing historical mutual fund data to evaluate performance, risk, and long-term investment potential.
- Using Python, the project gathers historical fund data, computes key financial metrics, benchmarks performance against high-growth companies, and evaluates long-term investment outcomes using - Time Value of Money (TVM) principles. The objective is to provide a data-driven framework for assessing mutual fund performance and simulating investment growth scenarios.

🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze historical mutual fund performance
- Calculate risk and return metrics
- fund performance against high-growth equity benchmarks
- Visualize ROI and volatility trends
- Evaluate long-term investment outcomes using compounding principles

📊 Key Metrics Calculated

- The project computes the following financial metrics:
- Average Returns – Mean periodic return of the mutual fund
- Volatility (Standard Deviation) – Measures risk based on return fluctuations
- Risk-Adjusted Returns – Performance relative to risk (e.g., Sharpe Ratio-style comparison)
- Return on Investment (ROI) – Overall profitability measure
These metrics allow a structured evaluation of both performance and risk exposure.

📉 Benchmark Comparison

- The project compares: ROI of the custom mutual fund plan & Volatility levels against High-growth companies from the dataset
- This comparison helps determine whether the mutual fund delivers competitive returns relative to higher-risk equity investments.

📊 Visualizations include:
- ROI comparison charts
- Volatility comparison graphs
- Risk vs Return scatter plots
- Stock Prie trend for companies
- Portfolio performance chart

💰 Time Value of Money (TVM) Assessment
The project includes a compounding investment simulation:
- Initial investment: ₹5,000
- Annual increase in investment: 10%
- Investment horizons: 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years
This section evaluates how disciplined investing and incremental contributions impact long-term wealth creation.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (financial calculations), Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization), Financial formulas for risk & return analysis

📈 Key Insights
- Risk-adjusted analysis provides better evaluation than raw returns alone
- High-growth companies may offer higher ROI but also significantly higher volatility
- Consistent incremental investing significantly enhances long-term portfolio value
- Compounding becomes substantially impactful beyond the 5-year horizon
